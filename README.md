# Churn Rate 1.0

Welcome to my machine learning project! Below, you'll find information about the Python version, setting up a virtual environment, and installing required packages.

## Python Version

This project requires Python 3.9. You can download and install Python 3.9 from the official Python website:

[Download Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

## TensorFlow Installation

To use TensorFlow for your machine learning tasks, you can follow the installation guide on the official TensorFlow website:

[Install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

This guide provides instructions for installing TensorFlow on various platforms and with different package managers.

## Setting up a Virtual Environment

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for your project, you can create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`. Here are the steps to create a virtual environment called `ml_env` on macOS using Python 3.9:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
   
3. ```virtualenv -p python3.9 ml_env```
4. ```source ml_env/bin/activate```
5. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
6. Run and debug ```main.py```
